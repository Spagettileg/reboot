# Re-Boot | Online exchange for new and used rugby boots 

Re-Boot is a non-profit making product exchange portal that provides a secure hub for the recyling of good quality rugby boots. The website targets the rugby playing community through keeping the cost of participation to an inexpensive level.  

A marketplace is created by the registered customer through donating unwanted rugby boots. For juniors, foot growth is the main reason for changing their boots, whereas adults may look to change for improved performance or manage issue of wear & tear. Irrespective of age or gender, Re-Boot aims to serve a rugby playing community with low-cost and good quality replacement boots at a fraction of the retail price.     

Once registered, customers will enjoy secure access to their own 'MyReBoot' webpage where the logged in user can donate unwanted rugby boots, create a blog post and reset their Re-Boot password.     

Furthermore, a reduced carbon footprint can be achieved through avoiding the purchase of brand new rugby boots and shift to product reuse to reduce unecessary landfill waste.

### Database Schema
Both SQLite3 (development) and postgreSQL (production) databases store the following tables:

`auth_user`
`blog_posts`
`checkout_orders`
`products_products`

1. [Schema Plan](https://github.com/Spagettileg/reboot-pbf/blob/master/schema/schemaplanv1.pdf) takes the original user stories to create a data conversion model. This model is then used to produce a formal database schema model, as shown in the plan and separated out below

2. [Data conversion model](https://github.com/Spagettileg/reboot-pbf/blob/master/static/img/convmodelv1.pdf)

3. [Schema model](https://github.com/Spagettileg/reboot-pbf/blob/master/static/img/schemamodelv1.pdf)

### CSS Framework
Bootstrap was the chosen framework for styling my project. I used the Bootstrap grid extensively to support responsiveness on mobile, tablet and desktop devices.  

### Colour Palette
Colours used in this project were sourced through consultation with my mentor [Simen Daehlin](simen.dehlin@gmail.com). Essentially, the colours are seeking to capture key attrbutes of rugby through energy, assertiveness and co-ordination.

Colour                       | Hex Code
-----------------------------|----------
Rich Black                   | #001514
White                        | #FFFFFF
Vivid Tangelo (Orange)       | #F26826
Blue Sapphire (Dark Green)   | #135A68
Space Cadet (Dark Blue)      | #21295C

### Typography
[Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/) & [Sans Serif](https://fonts.google.com/) fonts were used throughout this project. `H1` header was used in the home page to help qualify 'Why Re-Boot?'to the user. Thereafter, `H2` & `H3` was used for sub-heading narrative. 

`Font-weight` of `400` & `700` was used to help draw attention to the user for both branding and instruction too.

[Re-Boot](https://github.com/Spagettileg/reboot-pbf/blob/master/schema/typographyandcolourscheme.pdf) brand was self-built through use of MS Powerpoint tools.

### Icon Graphics
Font Awesome 5 icon graphics were used in conjunction with Bootstrap 4, primarily to support information page headers

- latest arrivals & boot quality = `fas fa-shoe-prints`
- faq's = `fas fa-comments`
- contact us - `far fa-inbox`
- privacy policy - `fas fa-lock`
- terms & conditions - `fas fa-exclamation-triangle`
- donate rugby boots - `far fa-handshake`
- blog post - `far fa-envelope`

### Navbar design
For Desktop view only, the navbar splits into 2 areas. There is an analogy here where rugby posts are split into 2, but connected bya crossbar. Re-Boot app is the crossbar supporting the split navbar posts. I appreciate this analogy maybe difficult to understand for anyone not following rugby.    

The logged in user also benefits from a cart pop-over function that informs the user of the following:

* User ID (Username)
* GBP value of cart contents
* Button to view detailed cart contents 

## Information Architecture
### Application Framework
Django application framework was a prerequisite in the design of this project, according to the project brief.

### Database Selection
Django framework is fast, secure and scalable. Provides a dynamic CRUD (create, read, update and delete) interface, configured with admin models and generated via introspection. requiring SQL database 
 - SQLITE3 database was used for development of this project on my local machine  
 - PostgresSQL was used support the full production of the Re-Boot website. An enterprise-level, object-relational DBMS that uses procedural languages like Perl and Python, in addition to SQL-level code  

### Data Models

- Blog images are stored in the `media` directory 

#### Checkout app model
Within the checkout app, `Order` and `OrderLineItem` models hold the data needed for users to create and pay for their orders.

##### Order model
Name              | DB Key          | Field Type    | Validation
------------------|-----------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------

Date              | date            | DateTimeField |             

- An `Order` model instance is created before any `OrderLineItems`. `OrderLineItems` rely on the `Order` model for a `ForeignKey`.

##### OrderLineItem model
Name     | DB Key   | Field Type                 | Validation
---------|----------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------
Order    | order    | ForeignKey to Order        | Order, null=False, on_delete=models.CASCADE
Product  | product  | ForeignKey to Product      | Product, null=False, on_delete=models.CASCADE
Quantity | quantity | PositiveSmallIntegerField  | 

- An OrderLineItem instance is created for each unique product in the users cart, linking a users existing Order, product and quantity the user elects to purchase

#### Products app model
Name      | DB Key           | Field Type    | Validation
----------|------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------

os.environ.setdefault("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY",'enter key details here')

os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_USER",'enter email details here')

os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_PASS",'enter key details here')
                      
```

8. If using AWS Cloud9, locate the settings.py file and add your environment variables as below. 
```
import os

import dj_database_url

if os.path.exists('env.py'):
    import env

"DATABASE_URL" in os.environ:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
    }

SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY')

ALLOWED_HOSTS = [os.getenv('AWSC9_HOST', 'reboot-pbf.herokuapp.com')]

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.getenv("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID")

AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.getenv("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY")

STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE = os.getenv('STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE')

STRIPE_SECRET = os.getenv('STRIPE_SECRET')

EMAIL_HOST_USER = os.environ.get('EMAIL_USER')

EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = os.environ.get('EMAIL_PASS')
```

`AWS C9 HOST` should be the local address for the site when running within your own IDE.

A developemnt environment variable is set only within the development environment, it does not exist in the deployed version, making it possible to have different settings for the two environments. For example setting `DEBUG` to `True` only when working in development and not on the deployed site.

9. Migrate the admin panel models to create your database template with the terminal commands

`python3 manage.py makemigrations`

`python manage.py migrate` to ensure all tables have been updated into your database  

10. Create your superuser to access the django admin panel and database with the following command, and then follow the steps to add your admin username and password:

`python3 manage.py createsuperuser`

11. The app can now be run locally with the following command:

`python3 manage.py runserver $IP:$PORT`

12. App should be running. Now use the local link provided and add /admin to the end of the url address. Login with your superuser account and create instances of new product within the new database.

13. Once instances of new products exist in your database, your local developemnt website will run as expected.

### Deployment to Heroku
The site has been formally deployed to [Heroku](https://reboot-pbf.herokuapp.com/) and the latest version of my application can be found here. The following steps were taken in order to deploy:

Apply the following steps to deploy Re-Boot app to herokus:

1. Create a `requirements.txt` file using the terminal command pip freeze > requirements.txt

2. Create a `Procfile` via the ubuntu bash terminal command `echo web: python3 app.py > Procfile`

3. Key `git add` and `git commit` the new requirements and Procfile and then `git push` the project to GitHub repository

4. Create a new app on the [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) website by clicking the "New" button in your dashboard. Give it a name and set the region to whichever is applicable for your location.

5. Your heroku dashboard will then invite you to click on "Deploy" > "Deployment method" and select GitHub

6. Check and confirm the heroku app is linked to the correct GitHub repository

7. Return to your heroku dashboard. Click on "Settings" > "Reveal Config Vars"

8. Complete the following config vars:

Key                      | Value
-------------------------|--------
`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`      | "Enter secret key"
`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`  | "Enter secret key"
`DATABASE_URL`           | "postgreSQL database url address"
`DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC`  | `1`
`SECRET_KEY`             | "Enter secret key"
`STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE`     | "Enter secret key"
`STRIPE_SECRET`          | "Enter secret key"

9. From the command line of your local IDE:

    - Enter the heroku postgres shell
    - Migrate the database models
    - Create your superuser account in your new database
    
Expert guidance on how to do these steps can be found in the [heroku devcenter documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql).

10. Return to your heroku dashboard. Click "Deploy". Scroll down to "Manual Deploy". Select the master branch then click "Deploy Branch"

11. Once the build is complete, click the "View app" button provided

12. From the link provided, append `/admin` to the end of the url address. Login with your superuser account and create instances of new products within the new database

13. Where instances of the new products exist in your database, your heroku production site will run as expected
