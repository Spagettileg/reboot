            <hr>
            <h5>Is Re-Boot free to join?</h5>
            <p>Yes, there is no fee payable to join Re-Boot. This is a non-profit making rugby boot recycling portal that
            is designed to encourage people to either view, donate &/or purchase rugby boots from the comfort of your own home.</p>
            
            <h5>How does ReBoot work?</h5>
            <p>Re-Boot primary goal is to create a market place for both donation and purchase of either brand new or second hand
            rugby boots. You dont need to register to view the current stock of rugby boots as this will always be available to the
            general public. However, if you wish to either donate &/or purchase rugby boots, then full registration to Re-Boot
            will be required.</p>
            
            <p>The general public can view the make, size, colour, stud type, quality and image of all boots in stock.</p>
            
            <p>All users will need to register by uploading their personal details and then enter their login credentials.
            Registered users will be able to donate their rugby boots via completing the online form in MyReBoot. The boot donator
            is <strong>fully responsible</strong> for cost of packaging and sending unwanted boots to Re-Boots' registered address
            (accessed when clicking on <strong>Help > <a class="text-warning" href="{% url 'contact' %}">Contact</a></strong>) in Re-Boot home page. </p>
            
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> If donators' rugby boots are <strong>not received within 7 working days</strong> of
            uploading their boot details in ReBoot, then ReBoot will look to remove the same boot details from ReBoot website.</p>
            
            <p>Replacement rugby boots can be viewed by the detailed listing or the user can use the 'Search' facility to locate a
            specific boot offering.  All selected replacements boots will then be captured into the shopping cart. Upon clicking
            the shopping cart icon (positioned at the top of the page), the registered user will proceed to a formal checkout
            process until they receive formal confirmation of a sale. </p>
            
            <p><strong>Registered user</strong> can add a review / feedback to cover their experience of using Re-Boot. The
            feedback is not mandatory, but completion of the same will help improve quality and future customer experience too.</p>

            <h5>What controls exist on rugby boot quality?</h5>
            <p>All registered members will have to voluntarily agree to an undertaking that donated rugby boots are no older
            than 12 months and the boots are categorised, as folows</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Brand New:</strong> Boots may have been tried on but not used. Leather upper, laces & studs in
                perfect condition. There maybe an original box too.</li>
                <li><strong>Almost New:</strong> Boots have been used once or twice. Very good condition.</li>
                <li><strong>General Wear & Tear:</strong> Boots have been worn extensively. Marks and abrasions highly likely.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><em><strong>Important:
            </strong> All boots are donated & purchased through upmost good faith. There is no right of action against Re-Boot
            in the event a purchased rugby boot falls below the set quality standards. If there is sufficent evidence of a purchased
            boot not being correctly represented in Re-Boot then the responsible boot donators membership will be cancelled with
            immediate effect. </em></p>
            
            <h5>What happens if my donated boots dont sell?</h5>
            <p>ReBoot will continue to advertise your donated boots until sold. There is an unwritten agreement that if the boots
            are not sold after 6 months then you should <strong><a class="text-warning" href="{% url 'contact' %}">contact</a></strong> Re-Boot to request the boots to be removed from the website. </p>

            <h5>Why dont I receive money for my donated rugby boots?</h5>
            <p>Under normal circumstances, unwanted rugby boots are either disposed of or given to charity, with zero compensation.
            The boot donation to Re-Boot contributes to creating a market place where a boot donator would want to secure a
            replacement pair of rugby boots. </p>
            
            <p>Donated stock allows the registered user to purchase quality replacement rugby boots at a fraction of shop retail prices.</p>
            
            <h5>Who receives the money for all rugby boot purchases?ses</h5>
            <p> Re-Boot receives the money and funds are both reinvested into the maintenance of the website and packaging / delivery costs of replacement
            boot purchases. No profit is generated via the replacement boot transactions.  </p>

            <h5>How much are replacement rugby boots?</h5>
            <p>Junior rugby boots (sizes from 8 - 2.5) are all priced at £5.00. Adults rugby boots (sizes from 3 - 15) are all priced at £10. </p>
            
            <h5>What countries does Re-Boot operate in?</h5>
            <p>UK only, excluding Republic of Ireland (ROI) </p>
            
            <h5>Who is responsible for the postal / shipping costs of the replacement rugby boots?</h5>
            <p>Re-Boot will cover the cost of delivering your replacement rugby boots. Registered postal service will be used. </p>
            
            <h5>Who is able to provide reviews and feedback?</h5>
            <p>Only registered users can provide reviews / feeback on their 'Re-Boot' experience. </p>
            
            <h5>Can I donate or purchase more than 1 pair of rugby boots?</h5>
            <p>Yes. There is no upper limit on your boot donations, subject to quality criteria being met. Replacement boots will always be subject to
            availability in latest published stock. </p>
            
            <h5>Can I wait to buy replacement boots even though I'm ready to donate my old pair?</h5>
            <p>Yes. Sometimes your preferred replacment boot may not be held in the current published stock. Re-Boot is happy to take your donated rugby boots
            in the interim. The members blog is useful to understand what replacment boots maybe in the pipeline, but not yest appearing in published
            stock. There is also a chance to send a message to the Re-Boot member community via the blog to place your request for replacement boots.  </p>
