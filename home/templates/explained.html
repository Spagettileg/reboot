                Re-Boot is a non-profit making product exchange portal that provides a secure hub for the recyling of good quality rugby boots. The website targets the rugby playing community through keeping the cost of participation to an inexpensive level. Furthermore,
                a reduced carbon footprint can be achieved through avoiding the purchase of brand new rugby boots and move to reuse to reduce unecessary waste.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you've registered as a Re-Boot member you will have full access to our <strong>BootShop</strong> that caters for both junior and adult sized rugby boots. Pricing is kept very simple as we only charge £5.00 for junior boots and £10.00
                for adult boots. Whilst Re-Boot cannot guarantee all sizes for all of our members, our current stock is built from our members generous free donation of unwanted boots. Acts of kindness creates and sustains the Re-boot <strong>BootShop</strong>.
                All Proceeds from sales go towards the maintenance of the Re-Boot website and cost of packaging of sending purchased boots.
            </p>
            <P>
                <strong>Normal practice</strong> is for our members to donate a pair of unwanted boots, before purchasing a replacement pair. This motion really helps keep the Bootshop in good working order.</P>
            <p>
                Our members can donate unwanted boots, change password and blog messages via their MyReBoot webpage. Furthermore, the Re-Boot blog is in place to encourage our community to connect on all things rugby related. We are always looking for new members to
                help grow Re-Boot for the benefit of our rugby playing community. If your browsing experience has been good, then why not go ahead and register today.
